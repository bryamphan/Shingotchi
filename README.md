# Shingotchi
A Tamagotchi-style pet game for me and my boyfriend. :)

**Day 1: Project Setup & Hello Pet**
- Create a new GitHub repo for your project.
- Set up a basic web project (index.html, style.css, script.js).
- Add a title and a cute placeholder (emoji or image) for your pet on the page.
- Commit and push your first version!

**Day 2: Pet Stats & UI**
- Decide on 2-3 pet stats (e.g., hunger, happiness, energy).
- Add these stats to your page (just as numbers or bars).
- Style them with a little color or fun font.

**Day 3: Interactions (Feed, Play, Rest)**
- Add buttons for actions: Feed, Play, Rest.
- Make clicking a button change the corresponding stat.
- Update the display so you can see the stats change.

**Day 4: Pet Mood & Reactions**
- Make your pet’s expression/image change based on its stats (happy, sad, sleepy, etc.).
- Add simple messages or emoji to show your pet’s mood.

**Day 5: Stats Decay & Challenge**
- Make stats decrease automatically every minute or so (simulate time passing).
- If stats get too low, show a “sad” pet; if high, make the pet extra happy.

**Day 6: Save Progress**
- Use localStorage so your stats and pet state are saved even if you close/reopen the browser.
- Add a “reset” button to start over.

**Day 7: Polish & Share**
- Add some cute styling and background.
- Write a fun README for your repo.
- Deploy your site for free (GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel).
- Share the link with your boyfriend!
